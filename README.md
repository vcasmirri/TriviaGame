# TriviaGame
A simple jQuery-based trivia game themed around everything Vince loves.
* Each of the questions is multiple choice and only allows one choice to be made.
* After each question, a splash screen tells you if you were correct.
* If incorrect, the splash screen displays the correct answer.
* After the final question (and its splash screen), a results page tells you your total number of correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions.
* The results page allows you to restart the trivia game.
